    "## Working with numerical data\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"data\" in *Data Analysis* typically refers to numerical data, e.g., stock prices, sales figures, sensor measurements, sports scores, database tables, etc. The [Numpy](https://numpy.org) library provides specialized data structures, functions, and other tools for numerical computing in Python. Let's work through an example to see why & how to use Numpy for working with numerical data.\n",

    "> Suppose we want to use climate data like the temperature, rainfall, and humidity to determine if a region is well suited for growing apples. A simple approach for doing this would be to formulate the relationship between the annual yield of apples (tons per hectare) and the climatic conditions like the average temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit), rainfall (in  millimeters) & average relative humidity (in percentage) as a linear equation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `yield_of_apples = w1 * temperature + w2 * rainfall + w3 * humidity`\n",
    "\n",
    "We're expressing the yield of apples as a weighted sum of the temperature, rainfall, and humidity. This equation is an approximation since the actual relationship may not necessarily be linear, and there may be other factors involved. But a simple linear model like this often works well in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on some statical analysis of historical data, we might come up with reasonable values for the weights `w1`, `w2`, and `w3`. Here's an example set of values:"
