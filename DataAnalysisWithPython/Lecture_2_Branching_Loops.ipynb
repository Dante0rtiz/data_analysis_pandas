    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of programming languages is *branching*: the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, branching is implemented using the `if` statement, which is written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "    statement2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` can be a value, variable or expression. If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements within the *`if` block* are executed. Notice the four spaces before `statement1`, `statement2`, etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the `if` statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called *indentation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Indentation**: Python relies heavily on *indentation* (white space before a statement) to define code structure. This makes Python code easy to read and understand. You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces. \n",
    "\n",

    "For example, let's write some code to check and print a message if a given number is even."

    "Can you see why `result` contains the value of the factorial of 100 at the end? If not, try adding `print` statements inside the `while` block to print `result` and `i` in each iteration.\n",

    "> Iteration is a powerful technique because it gives computers a massive advantage over human beings in performing thousands or even millions of repetitive operations really fast. With just 4-5 lines of code, we were able to multiply 100 numbers almost instantly. The same code can be used to multiply a thousand numbers (just change the condition to `i <= 1000`) in a few seconds.\n",

    "You can check how long a cell takes to execute by adding the *magic* command `%%time` at the top of a cell. Try checking how long it takes to compute the factorial of `100`, `1000`, `10000`, `100000`, etc. "
